        Sean is an undergraduate student at Northeastern University studying Computer Science and Biology. He uses this site as a personal soapbox. <br><br>

        He enjoys playing, listening to, and writing music. You can challenge him in a game of Go <a href="https://online-go.com/user/view/321486" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>

       Anatomically speaking, he still has all of his toes.<br>

       Comically speaking, he thinks puns are good, and jokes about writing in the third person are bad.
