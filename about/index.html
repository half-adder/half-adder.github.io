<p>Hello, and welcome to my website. My name is Sean Johnsen. I am currently pursuing an undergrad degree in Computer Science as well as in Cellular/Molecular Biology in the beautiful city of Boston.</p>
<p>When I'm not programming, I enjoy playing and <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/sjohnsen2014" target="_blank">listening to music</a> (I'm slowly but surely learning to play rock guitar). I enjoy playing <a href="https://online-go.com/user/view/321486" target="_blank">Go</a>, but I'm not great.</p>
