  Sean (that's me!) is a student at Northeastern University in Boston, MA. He currently works at {TripAdvisor} as a {Security Operations Engineer}. Mostly that means {doing data analytics to see if bad stuff is happening to the company}! When he's not programming, he likes to do fun stuff like <a href='/photography/'>taking pictures</a>, <a href='/art/'>drawing things</a> and <a href='/bookthoughts/'>reading cool books</a>.
