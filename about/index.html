<div id='about_me'>
<p>Hello, and welcome to my website. My name is Sean Johnsen. I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science in the beautiful city of Boston. My current interests include database design, operating systems, programming languages, and statistics.</p>
<p>When I'm not programming, I enjoy playing and listening to music (I play rock guitar and classical cello). I also enjoy practicing martial arts (Aikido/Hapkido), and playing <a href="">Go</a> (my current rank is 23 kyu - if you're not familiar with Go, that is very low!).</p>
<p>I also enjoy reading and writing. I read non-fiction for the most part, but also enjoy fantasy and science fiction. If you would like to see a collection of the books I have read and my thoughts on them, you can find them somewhere around here...</p>
<p>If you happen to be interested in my thoughts and opinions, you can find them on my blog, linked above. I also maintain a list of places around the internet that I find interesting and compelling. Feel free to read them and let me know what you think!</p>
