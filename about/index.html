<p>Hello, and welcome to my website. My name is Sean Johnsen. I am currently pursuing an undergrad degree in Computer Science as well as in Cellular/Molecular Biology in the beautiful city of Boston.</p>
<p>When I'm not programming, I enjoy playing and <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/sjohnsen2014" target="_blank">listening to music</a> (I'm slowly but surely learning to play rock guitar). I enjoy playing <a href="https://online-go.com/user/view/321486" target="_blank">Go</a>, but I'm not great.</p>
<p>I also enjoy reading and writing. I read sci-fi and non-fiction for the most part, but other genres here and there. If you would like to see a collection of my thoughts on some of the books I have read, you can find them <a href="">here</a>...</p>
<p>If you happen to be interested in my thoughts and opinions, you can find them on my blog, linked above. I also maintain a list of places around the internet that I find interesting and compelling. Feel free to read them and let me know what you think!</p>
