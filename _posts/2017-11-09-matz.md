I'm very excited to announce that I will be an official SCIENTIST starting in January.

I've been working for the past year or so in [Javier Apfeld's lab](http://apfeldlab.strikingly.com/), studying the molecular and genetic pathways that regulate the aging process in the nematode *C. elegans* (we call ourselves the Worm Immortality Team).

My school has a program where students alternate between 6-month stretches of taking classes and working full-time on co-op. I wrote a grant proposal for my very own research project in the Apfeld Lab around 2 months ago, and the funding is officially secure!

I will be studying the role of two neurotransmitters - Tyramine and Octopamine - in the TGF-Î² pathway in *C. elegans*. We think that this pathway regulates how resistant to oxidative stress the animals are. This is relevant to aging, as oxidative stress is thought to be a [major contributor to aging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-radical_theory_of_aging) and age-related disease.

I recently (a year ago) switched from studying Computer Science to studying both Computer Science and Biolgoy. This will be my first professional forray into academia, and I can't wait to get started!
