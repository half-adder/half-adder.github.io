I was walking in the forests of New Hampshire and stumbled across these really cool looking plants.

As you can see they're completely white, but they don't seem to be dead. When I got back to civilization, I did some research. It turns out to be a species called *Monotropa uniflora*. It turns out that these are **PARASITIC PLANTS**! WHAT! I'd never heard of this.

As it turns out, these plants don't use photosynthesis to make food like a normal plant, no instead they SUCK THE ENERGY FROM A TREE INSTEAD. Hell yeah.So since they don't need to photosynthesize, they don't produce any chlorophyll, and they're white. 

So apparently parasitic plants are a thing, and they look super cool.
