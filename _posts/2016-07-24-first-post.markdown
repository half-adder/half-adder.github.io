Hello, and welcome to my weblog! If you are reading this, you are in the future. And *that* is pretty cool. Once in a while I'll think about something, so this will mostly be a place where I am going to try to make words out of the things that I think. Maybe I'll throw some projects up here. Who's gonna stop me? Come with me as we explore the internet in all of its splendor.
