# I.

It is 1935 in Australia, and the gray-backed cane beetle population is in full swing. They are native to Australia, but a pest for farmers, as the beetles feed on the leaves of crops, and the larvae on the roots. The Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations are desperate. The beetles are hard to get rid of, as they bury into the soil, and the pesticides available to them would harm other innocuous species as well.

10 years previous, the [Cactus Moth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cactoblastis_cactorum) was used to control the invasive [Prickly Pear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opuntia_stricta) population. The BSES is (justifiably) enamored with the [wild success](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1049964498906089) of the project. Perhaps a similar method could be used to control the cane beetle population? 

The [Cane toad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cane_toad) is shipped in from Hawaii. A few thousand cane toads are released into the wild, and the BSES believes that they have once again conquered pestilence. 

They could not have been more wrong. 

The toads are not believed to have had any significant impact on the beetle population, and what's more, the toads have themsleves become an ecological disaster for Australia. They are currently estimated to number in the hundreds of millions. They spread disease. They poison and kill those that eat them. The Kakadu National Park considers the cane toad to be one of the largest threats to their biodiversity.

One of the issues I feel most at odds with with fellow young adults is on the topic of censorship.
