## I.

It is 1935 in Australia, and the gray-backed cane beetle population is in full swing. They are native to Australia, but a pest for farmers, as the beetles feed on the leaves of crops, and the larvae on the roots. The Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations are desperate. The beetles are hard to get rid of, as they bury into the soil, and the pesticides available to them would harm other innocuous species as well.
10 years previous, the [Cactus Moth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cactoblastis_cactorum) was used to control the invasive [Prickly Pear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opuntia_stricta) population. The BSES was (justifiably) enamored with the [wild success](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1049964498906089) of the project. Perhaps a similar method could be used to control the cane beetle population? 

A few thousand [Cane toads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cane_toad) are shipped in from Hawaii and released into the wild, and the BSES pats itself on the back for once again conquering pestilence. 

The back-pats, I am sorry to say, were oh-so-premature.

The toads are not believed to have had any significant impact *whatsoever* on the beetle population, and what's more, the toads have themsleves become an ecological disaster for Australia. They are currently estimated to number in the hundreds of millions. They spread disease. They poison and kill those that eat them. The Kakadu National Park considers the cane toad to be one of the largest threats to their biodiversity. Killing these toads has literally become a national pastime.

## II.

I was talking with my roommates about a month ago about some speaker that students at my school didn't want voicing his opinions. There is no shortage of arguments one can find the internet about this topic, but it's one that keeps popping up in my life and so I feel like I should write about it. 


What's the problem? These people are racists, homophobes, even *Neo-Nazis* we're talking about here! They're the baddest of the bad! They're fire hydrants of bile! So why in the name of all that is cute n' cuddly would we let them come and spew their bile all over the tulips that our university just planted?

BECAUSE EVERYTHING FALLS APART IF WE DON'T THAT'S WHY.

First, by not letting these idiots projectile-vomit hatred into the undeserving ear canals of undergraduates, liberals are *giving the other side ammunition*. "The Left's Opposition to Freedom of Speech" becomes a talking point for pundits on the Right! And once the right starts talking about how liberals hate free speech, free speech becomes a polarizing issue.

All of a sudden [No True Liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman) is pro-free speech. Even now, speaking in favor of free exchange of ideas gets me suspicious looks amongst my peers.

That is bad news bears for free speech. All of a sudden, it starts hanging out with the shady kids in its class. Abortion, gun ownership, gay marriage, ... . What do these things have in commmon? Falling on one side of the fence or the other makes you *de facto* a Liberal or a Conservative. It works in the opposite direction, too. Identifying as a Conservative or a Liberal means you are *compelled* to think this way or that on these most divisive issues, which means that 50% of the country is "Pro X" and the other 50% is "Anti X". We do not want half of the country to be against free speech, for reasons that I hope are obvious. 

The cane toad of censorship is not only not effective against the cane beetles of racism, bigotry, and general asshattery, but it actively tears apart the Australian ecosystem of American political discourse. Wait...
