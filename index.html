    Sean (that's me!) is a student at Northeastern University in Boston, MA. He currently works at <span class='thing'>{TripAdvisor}</span> as a <span class='thing'>{Security Operations Engineer}</span>. Mostly that means <span class='thing'>{using data analytics to see if bad stuff is happening to the company}</span>! When he's not programming, he likes to do fun stuff like <a target='_blank 'href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/134641024@N03/'>taking pictures</a>, <a href='/art/'>drawing things</a> and <a target='_blank' href='https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42659704-sean-johnsen'>reading cool books</a>.
