Hello, and welcome to my website. My name is Sean Johnsen. I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science in the beautiful city of Boston. My current interests include database design, operating systems, programming languages, and statistics.

When I'm not programming, I enjoy playing and listening to music (I'm slowly but surely learning to play guitar). I'm also learning to play <a href="">Go</a> (my current rank is 23 kyu - if you're not familiar with Go, that is very low!). Additionally, I'm really fond of climbing. Check out some of my <a href="">pictures</a>.

I also enjoy reading and writing. I read non-fiction for the most part, but also enjoy fantasy and science fiction. If you would like to see a collection of the books I have read and my thoughts on them, you can find them somewhere around here...

If you happen to be interested in my thoughts and opinions, you can find them on my blog, linked above. I also maintain a list of places around the internet that I find interesting and compelling. Feel free to read them and let me know what you think!
